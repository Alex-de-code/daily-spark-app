## Features

### Home Page

You are greeted with a "Spark of the Day" along with the date. This date is actually dynamic and updates based on the day. You will also see "Popular Sparks" this will show you some popular sparks on our platform.

### Viewing Quotes/Filtering Quotes

In the nav baryou can click "Sparks" to view all the sparks. Or in "Popular Sparks" you can click the redirection link. Here you can view all the sparks along with a filtered system. By clicking the selected category the sparks will change depending on your selection. Let's just say you want to revert back to all the sparks, we included an orange "All Sparks" button!

### Creating Spark

By clicking "Make a Spark" in the nav bar you will be taken to a page that is a form. Here at Daily Sparks we wanted to give the user the opportunity to collab with us and voice their quotes. Here you will be able to input your spark, name and select the category you wish it to be grouped in. As soon as you click submit your spark will display in the "Your Sparks" section. Also! you are now a part of the spark database. If you head over to the "Sparks" you will find yourself there now!

### Updating Sparks/ Deleting Sparks

We all make mistakes here and there. But Spark quotes allows you to fix them. With every spark you create. It will be displayed along with a trash can and pencil icon. If you click the trash can the spark automatically gets deleted from "Your Sparks" and the database. If you click the pencil icon another form will appear that is already filled in for you. Then you can make the changes to your desires.

### About the Devs

In the top right of the header we have provided a button when clicked will bring you to the "About the Developers" page. Here, you will get to know more about the creators of this application.
